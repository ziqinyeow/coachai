ground truth file are all type - net shot and land at area - front net,,,,,
"in prediction, we predict rally sequences for 3 different condition",,,,,
"For 0, we predict type - net shot prob 1.0, area - front net",,,,,
"For 1, we predict type - net shot prob 1.0, area - non front net",,,,,
"For 2, we predict type - lob prob 0.5 smash prob 0.5, area - front net",,,,,
